    // of this retry issue:
    //
    //  - The first time searching, we do not know if we need to insert. To
    //    avoid unnecessary allocations, we do not allocate a node for this
    //    element until the first search has turned up empty.
    //  - When we discover we need to retry, we have already allocated the
    //    node for the element, moving the element into the heap. We do not
    //    want to deallocate it for the search, because we would likely need
    //    to allocate it again once we find that the element is still not
    //    present.
    //
    // For this reason, we access the element during search through the
    // "elem_ptr" variable, which could point either to the element in the
    // stack or the element in the heap. We manage dropping/forgetting the elem
    // correctly using a ManuallyDrop wrapper. The `new_node` pointer is used
